		 * A benchmark was performed, querying the condition with a large loop.
		 * Only at the looping 1000000 times did performance decrease.
		 * Before that, 100000 times caused a possible FPS drop.
		 * 
		 * Using KeyQuery shortcuts:
		 * 		1000000 - 11-12 FPS using KeyQuery.
		 * 
		 * Replaced Condition with BooleanSupplier.
		 * 		1000000 - 11-12 FPS using KeyQuery.
		 * 
		 * Replaced Script with Consumer<Integer>.
		 * 		1000000 - 12    FPS using KeyQuery.
		 * 
		 * Smashed everything into KeyLogic.
		 *      1000000 - 11-12 FPS using KeyQuery. 
		 *      
		 * Got rid of SplitConditional and inheritors.
		 * 		1000000 - 12 	FPS using KeyQuery.
		 * 		~260 MB
		 * 
		 * Moved util methods out of KeyUtils and into the containing KeyLogic.
		 * 		1000000 - 12	FPS using KeyQuery.
		 * 		~258 MB
		 * 
		 * Moved KeyCondition lambdas to variables in Bindings class.
		 * 		1000000 - 12	FPS using KeyQuery.
		 * 		~260 MB
		 * 
		 * Replaced the frictiontoggle with FrictionWhenEquilibrium component.
		 * 		1000000 - 13-15 FPS using KeyQuery.
		 * 		~258 MB
		 * 
		 * Power testing by repeating the render() method in _MainRunner by powers of 2:
		 * 
		 * 2^5 : 58-60  FPS
		 * 2^6 : 54-60	FPS
		 * 2^7 : 31-34 	FPS : 265 MB
		 * 
		 * Reached noticable level.
		 * 
		 * Switched to verbose KeyConditions for all keyconditions, and removed KeyQuery.
		 * 		 
		 * 		 30-35	FPS : 263 MB
		 *
		 * Over entire render() method, replaced frictiontoggle back, 31-32 FPS.
